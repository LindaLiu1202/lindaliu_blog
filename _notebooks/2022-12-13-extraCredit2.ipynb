    "I really agree with the idea that learning how to code is learning a way of thinking,a critical, problem solving thinking, also with the idea of learning how to learn.\n",
    "When we encounter things that we don't know in coding, we would search it up and try to figure it out ourselves, then ask for help, this is the process of learning how to learn. Only information taught in class is not enough, and especially there are so many resources online, we are learning how to take use of those resources and exercising our ability to solve problem on our own, which I think is a really impactful and beneficial mindset even for the future career or life. This is a good mindset (critical thinking, problem solving mindset) to have even in other fields, not just computer science. I also really agree that the most useful skill to have is continuous learning and also be adaptive. We all would still be learning in the future outside of school, but more of learning on our own which is driven by motivation within ourselves. I think that the earlier we adapt to these mindset and get use to learning continuous, it would be really helpful and beneficial for any job in the future."
