# “Psychology and the Good Life” 

 - It's nothing if you only know the good psychology and the good life without taking actions.
 - Exercise and sleep are important to maintain a good psychology and good life, and it is important to put them in actions.
   - I personally lack exercise and sleep because of procrastination. 
   
 # Gratitude List
 
  - my family
    - my mom
  - my friends
      - emily
      - ally
      - enze
      - max
  - my teachers
      
 i am grateful for my family, my friends, and my teachers. 
 Especially, I want to thank my mom for supporting me in studying and helping me when I encountered problems. 
 I also want to thank my friend Ally for supporting me when I got into the drama/conflict last time, and I learned a lot from her. 
 
 
 # Goals
 
  - In order to get enough sleep and exercise to maintain a healthy and good life
    - Goal 1 - go to sleep at 12am everyday
    - Goal 2 - learn a new dance every weekened
    
    - I would be a more happy person after acheving and maintaining these goals because my mom usually would be mad at me if I stayed up really late, and also staying up late is making me sleepy during classes, which is not a good thing.
