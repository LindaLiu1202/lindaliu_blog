    "- An object is a specific instance of a class with defined attributes. Objects are declared as variables of a class type.\n",
    "- An attribute or instance variable is data the object knows about itself. For example a turtle object knows the direction it is facing or its color.\n",
    "- A behavior or method is something that an object can do. For example a turtle object can go forward 100 pixels."
