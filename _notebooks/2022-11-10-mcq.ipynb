    "Explanation: The seqSearchRecHelper recursive method does not work as intended when target does not appear in data. In this case, when last becomes -1, the method will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in the first if statement after line 1. To prevent this, we should add a check to see if last is less than 0 and if it is, return -1 as expected.\n",

    "Explanation: Choice II has a loop control variable k that starts at 0, increments by 1, and will terminate the loop when k has the value data.length. In each iteration, there is a check to see if the current value is larger than the subsequent value. If it is, false is returned because elements would not be nondecreasing. For example, if data[k] had the value 5 and data[k + 1] had the value 4, then data would contain an instance where the values were decreasing. Unfortunately, since the indices of an array start at 0 and go through data.length – 1, when k has the value data.length – 1 an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException will be thrown as the condition attempts to check data[data.length – 1] and data[data.length – 1 + 1] or data[data.length]."

    "Explanation: The for loop control variable k starts with the value 3, is incremented by 1 and terminates the loop when its value is arr.length – 1. In the first iteration, when k is 3, arr[3] is assigned the value arr[4]. The contents of the arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7}. In the second iteration, when k is 4, arr[4] is assigned the value arr[5]. The contents of arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7}. In the third iteration, when k is 5, arr[5] is assigned the value arr[6]. The contents of arr have been updated to {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7}. Then k is incremented to 6 and the loop terminates."
