<ul>
  <li>It’s nothing if you only know the good psychology and the good life without taking actions.</li>
  <li>Exercise and sleep are important to maintain a good psychology and good life, and it is more important to put them in actions.
    <ul>
      <li>This relates to me personally because I lack exercise and sleep due to procrastination and not taking action although I know the important of sleep and exercise.</li>
      <li>Set up goals for when to sleep and exercise.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gratitude-list">Gratitude List</h3>

<ul>
  <li>my family
    <ul>
      <li>my mom</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>my friends
    <ul>
      <li>emily</li>
      <li>ally</li>
      <li>enze</li>
      <li>max</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>my teachers</li>
</ul>

<p>i am grateful for my family, my friends, and all of my teachers. 
 Especially, I want to thank my mom for supporting me in studying and helping me when I encountered problems. She won’t force me to do things that I don’t like and is always supportive of my interests and hobbies.
 I want to thank my friend Ally for supporting me when I got into the drama/conflict last time, and I learned a lot from her. I am also grateful for my friend Emily because we can complain or talk about anything with each other without any worries, which I am very thankful to have a friend like her.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In order to get enough sleep and exercise to maintain a healthy and good life
    <ul>
      <li>Goal 1 - go to sleep at 12am everyday</li>
      <li>
        <p>Goal 2 - learn a new dance every weekend (exercise)</p>
      </li>
      <li>I would be a more happy person after acheving and maintaining these goals because my mom usually would be mad at me if I stayed up really late, and also staying up late is making me sleepy during classes and is bad for my health.</li>
      <li>Dancing is also a great way of getting exercise, and also it’s something that I like to do.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
